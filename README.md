# 1337-42-Projects
42(1337) School is a unique coding school that offers free education to anyone who wants to learn programming. Instead of traditional classes, students work on real-world projects and learn from each other. There are no teachers or tuition fees. Students can learn at their own pace and complete challenges that help them develop valuable tech skills. Founded by French entrepreneur Xavier Niel, 42 School has campuses around the world and prepares students for successful careers in technology.

1. Libft (Library Functions):
Libft is one of the first projects that introduces students to the C programming language. Students are tasked with creating their own standard C library by reimplementing common standard library functions. This project helps students understand fundamental programming concepts such as memory allocation, pointers, and data structures.

2. Get_Next_Line:
In this project, students build a function that reads a line from a file descriptor, one line at a time. It reinforces concepts from Libft, such as memory management and efficient data handling, while introducing file I/O operations.

3. Born2beroot:
Born2beroot is a systems administration project where students set up and configure a virtual machine using a specified operating system. This project covers basic concepts of system management, including user permissions, network configurations, and security best practices.

4. Ft_printf:
This project involves recreating the printf function from the C standard library. It requires students to handle various formatting options, which deepens their understanding of variable argument lists, string manipulation, and buffer management.

5. Minitalk:
Minitalk involves creating a small data exchange program using Unix signals. Students learn about inter-process communication by implementing a client-server architecture where messages are transmitted between two processes.

6. So_Long:
So_Long is a graphical project where students create a 2D game (pac man style) using the MinilibX library. They design the game’s logic, implement player movement, and handle basic graphical rendering, which introduces them to event-driven programming and basic game development concepts.

7. Push_Swap:
Push_Swap challenges students to sort a stack of numbers using a limited set of operations and the fewest moves possible. It focuses on algorithm design, efficiency, and complexity analysis, encouraging students to think critically about their approach to solving the problem.

8. Philosophers
In the Philosophers project, students simulate a scenario where a certain number of philosophers sit at a table with a fork between each pair. Philosophers alternate between thinking and eating. However, to eat, a philosopher needs to pick up two forks — one from their left and one from their right. The challenge is to devise a solution that ensures that the philosophers can eat without causing a deadlock or starvation focusing on Thread/Process Management , synchronization primitives such as mutexes, semaphores.

9. Minishell
In the Minishell project, students are tasked with developing a small shell program that can interpret and execute commands typed by the user. The shell should replicate many of the basic features found in modern Unix-like shells. This project emphasizes a range of concepts including process management, file system navigation, and the use of system calls.
